# week3assignment

This week I was really happy to acheive all of the main goals for the assignment. It took a fair bit of help from Manny and Joe to point me in the right direction when first facing each individual task, but my confidence was definitely boosted in applying the different elements we learned to a project outside of the workshops. I found writing psuedo-code to be useful in helping me visualise the exact process I needed to translate into syntax and, once my loop had been finally completed, I could use the code I had already as a jumping off point for the next task. I think I may have unknowingly completed a stretch goal by managing all my upgrades in the one function, but I didn't want to push myself too far this week while I'm still grappling with the basics.
After getting the JavaScript down, my next challenge was CSS. I am comfortable with certain functions but still a little out of my depth in terms of positioning. In terms of feedback, I'd love some in regards to making containers for positioning/positioning overall as the elements being created in JavaScript did confuse me. My wireframe (in assets) was a far cry from the final result. I did however, create a bit of pixel art for my main icon, but this was something simple I was already comfortable with.
Overall, I am really really pleased with my progress this week, and feel I have come a long way since the last assignment where I struggled to do much more than sketch out some basic code.
